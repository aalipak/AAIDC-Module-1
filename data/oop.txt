Q1: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
A1: OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects containing data and behavior. It helps organize code for reusability and scalability.

Q2: What are the four pillars of OOP?
A2: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Q3: What is Encapsulation?
A3: It means bundling data and related methods together in a class and restricting direct access using private or protected modifiers.
Example:
class Car {
  private speed = 0;
  accelerate() { this.speed += 10; }
}

Q4: What is Abstraction?
A4: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary features.
Example:
abstract class Shape {
  abstract area(): number;
}

Q5: What is Inheritance?
A5: When one class derives properties and methods from another class.
Example:
class Animal { eat() {} }
class Dog extends Animal { bark() {} }

Q6: What is Polymorphism?
A6: It allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object.
Example:
class Bird { speak() { return "Chirp"; } }
class Dog { speak() { return "Bark"; } }

Q7: What are constructors?
A7: Special methods used to initialize object properties when an instance is created.

Q8: What is the difference between a class and an object?
A8: A class is a blueprint; an object is an instance of that blueprint.

Q9: What is method overriding?
A9: Redefining a parent class method in a child class.

Q10: What is method overloading?
A10: Having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (not directly supported in JS, simulated by optional params).

Q11: What are access modifiers?
A11: Keywords that set the visibility of class members, e.g., public, private, protected.

Q12: What is a static method?
A12: A method that belongs to the class rather than an instance.
Example:
class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) { return a + b; }
}

Q13: What is composition in OOP?
A13: Building complex objects by combining simpler ones instead of using inheritance.
Example:
class Engine {}
class Car { constructor(engine) { this.engine = engine; } }

Q14: What is the difference between aggregation and composition?
A14: Composition means strong ownership (object cannot exist without parent); aggregation means weak ownership.

Q15: Why is OOP important?
A15: It improves modularity, maintainability, and code reuse.
