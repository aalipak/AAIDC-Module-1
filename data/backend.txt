Q1: What is Node.js?
A1: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side using the V8 engine.

Q2: Why use Node.js for backend?
A2: It's fast, scalable, event-driven, and non-blocking — perfect for I/O-heavy apps.

Q3: What is Express.js?
A3: A lightweight Node.js framework used to build web servers and APIs easily.

Q4: How do you create a simple Express server?
A4:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World'));
app.listen(3000);

Q5: What is middleware in Express?
A5: Functions that execute between request and response, used for logging, auth, etc.
Example:
app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log(req.method); next(); });

Q6: What is the difference between app.use() and app.get()?
A6: `app.use()` is for middleware or routes for all methods, while `app.get()` handles only GET requests.

Q7: What is REST API?
A7: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture style for building APIs using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Q8: How do you send JSON data in a response?
A8:
app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ name: "Aali", role: "Developer" });
});

Q9: How do you handle POST requests in Express?
A9:
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/user', (req, res) => res.send(req.body));

Q10: What is the purpose of body-parser or express.json()?
A10: To parse incoming JSON request bodies so they can be accessed via `req.body`.

Q11: What are environment variables in Node.js?
A11: Variables stored outside code (in `.env`) for configuration.
Example:
require('dotenv').config();
const PORT = process.env.PORT;

Q12: What is asynchronous programming in Node.js?
A12: Using callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle tasks that take time (like API calls) without blocking the main thread.

Q13: What is error handling middleware?
A13: A special middleware that catches and handles errors.
Example:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => res.status(500).send(err.message));

Q14: How do you connect Node.js with a database?
A14: Using database drivers or ORMs like Mongoose for MongoDB or Sequelize for SQL.

Q15: What is CORS and how do you enable it?
A15: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing — allows APIs to be accessed from other domains.
Example:
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
