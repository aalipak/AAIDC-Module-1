Q1: What is SDLC?
A1: SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is the process of planning, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systematically.

Q2: What are the main phases of SDLC?
A2: 
1. Requirement Gathering  
2. System Design  
3. Implementation (Development)  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment  
6. Maintenance

Q3: Why is SDLC important?
A3: It ensures software is delivered on time, meets quality standards, and satisfies user needs.

Q4: What are common SDLC models?
A4: Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, V-Model, and Iterative models.

Q5: What is the Waterfall model?
A5: A linear approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next.

Q6: What is the Agile model?
A6: An iterative approach where work is done in short cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback.

Q7: What are the advantages of Agile?
A7: Flexibility, fast feedback, early delivery, and improved customer satisfaction.

Q8: What is Scrum in Agile?
A8: A framework in Agile that organizes work into sprints (usually 2–4 weeks) with defined roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team.

Q9: What is a sprint?
A9: A short, time-boxed period where a specific set of work is completed in Agile projects.

Q10: What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall?
A10: Waterfall is sequential and rigid; Agile is iterative and adaptive to change.

Q11: What happens in the testing phase?
A11: QA engineers verify that the software works as expected through unit, integration, and system tests.

Q12: What happens in the deployment phase?
A12: Software is released to users or production environments.

Q13: What is maintenance in SDLC?
A13: Fixing bugs, improving performance, or updating features after deployment.

Q14: What are functional and non-functional requirements?
A14: Functional define system behavior; non-functional describe system quality (e.g., performance, security, scalability).

Q15: What is CI/CD in modern SDLC?
A15: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment — automating code integration, testing, and deployment for faster delivery.
Example tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins.

Q16: What are version control systems?
A16: Tools that manage code changes and collaboration.
Example: Git.
